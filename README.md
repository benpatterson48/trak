Most financial apps simply display what you've paid by connecting to your bank account, but, Trak gives you the power to control your finances.

Easily log your monthly expenses, bills, and payments and keep track of what you've paid and what you have left.

You can easily filter your expenses by category to have a better idea of what you're spending.
